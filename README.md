##### A project by MyEtherWallet.

## Warnings
- **This is a brand-spanking-new. It doesn't work all the time.**
- Please do not place any keys with larges amounts into your new mewify keystore folder for the time being.
- Windows builds are hard. Please join our Slack to get assistance. 

## If you have a problem
- Please open a github issue.
- Pretty please: open a github issue. ðŸ˜ƒ
- Or join our Slack #mewify channel and debug w/ us.
- If possible, we would LOVE you if you could include the following in your issue:
    - your OS
    - OS version
    - What you are trying to connect to (mist, ethereum wallet, other?)
    - Red errors in the console (right click anywhere in Mewify and click "Inspect")
    - Warnings in displayed in your command line
    - Warnings that are displayed via notifications.
    - What you were doing and/or trying to do when this happened. e.g...
        - I opened the app up and it died ðŸ˜ž.
        - I tried to send a transaction and it died.
        - I successfully sent a transaction but now my computer turned into a dragon and attacked me. Here is the TX ID as a link to etherscan.io because even though I'm being attacked by a rabid computer-dragon, I still understand how much easier it makes your life when I give you links.

## Getting up and running
- Install Node (w/ npm)
    - We are running Node v7.4. It should work with older version but if you are getting errors, try updating node first.
        - If you need specific versions of node for different projects, get `nvm`. Seriously. Then it's as simple as `nvm install 7.4` & `nvm use 7.4`
        - You can update update node via npm:
            - `sudo npm cache clean -f`
            - `sudo npm install -g n`
            - `sudo n stable`
            - `sudo npm update -g`
- Install nw.js globally:
    - `sudo npm install nw --nwjs_build_type=sdk -g` *TODO: see if we can do this automagically? I don't think so because global?*
- Clone / download the Mewify repo
- `cd path/to/folder`
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
- `npm start`
- The Mewify applet should automatically open up.
- Mewify should have filled-in fields 1 button showing. If it has empty fields / 3 buttons, it's not working properly. Make sure gulp is running?
- Click the "Start" button

## Interacting with Dapps in Ethereum Wallet / Mist
- Get it up and running (see above)
- Open Mist or Ethereum Wallet
- Your chain should be fully synced after a couple seconds.
- Create a new account or copy and paste a test wallet into the keystore folder. You can change the keystore folder in the Mewify app.
- In order to use your existing keys, copy and paste them to the key folder that is shown under "Keystore Location" in Mewify. They should now show up in Mist/EW.
- **Note: Please don't move big keys into this folder, or change to use your default keystore folder further testing has been done.**

## Interacting with Dapps in Chrome (? does this work ?)
- Get it up and running (see above)
- Open that page in Chrome
- Interact and try to send transaction
- Enter the **incorrect** password in your browser!! (This makes it so you don't have to trust the dapp / your browser! ðŸ˜ƒ)
- Mewify will show confirmation screen
- Enter **correct** password in Mewify
- Confirm transaction

## Running Tests
- Install `mocha` globally:
	-  `npm install -g mocha`
- Run test command:
	- `npm test`
